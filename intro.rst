Introduction and Target Audience
================================

This document is intended to be a collection of the wisdom learned about developing games for the OLPC XO, with a special focus on the goals of the students taking CISC374 at the University of Delaware. We won't talk too much about developing individual games, as that varies widely from year to year and team to team, but instead we'll focus on the differences and particular challenges that are faced when placing these games on the OLPC, and some ways to overcome those challenges. Each section will conclude with links for additional reading that will often include more depth and breadth than will be presented here.

While we will focus mostly on the needs of the course at the University of Delaware, most of the material is generally applicable for developing pygame-based activities for the OLPC XO.

The OLPC XO
-----------

* Talk about Chester and why OLPCs. Talk about the hardware on XO-1 and XO-1.5 (also perhaps XO-1.75). Compare the hardware to modern cellphones. Be sure to mention screen resolution, it's an important factor *

Pygame and Spyral
-----------------

* Talk a bit about why pygame was chosen, the upsides and downsides to that. Talk briefly about why spyral was written, the upsides and downsides to using spyral, and the benefit it has been to the course *

Alternatives to Pygame
----------------------
* Talk about GTK, about why other toolkits are generally not an option *

Additional Reading
------------------
* Some links to the OLPC wiki, pygame's about, spyral's about, pygtk's about, cisc374 wiki, etc.
