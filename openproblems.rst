Open Tasks
==========

Although our `github <https://github.com/platipy/>`_ is the canonical source for new issues, we wanted a nicely curated list of the "Big Issues" still present in our tools. If you are interested in contributing to an open-source project to support education of disadvantaged youth, please get involved!

Spyral
------

* Advanced physics through Box2D
* Audio API (perhaps even just exposing Pygame's)
* More widgets (e.g., radio button, drop-down menus, multi-line textbox)
* Unit tests
* Absolute positioning: Sprites currently report their position within parents, not an absolute position on the screen
* Static sprites: sprites that will always be static, emulating part of the background
* Hex-grids: Currently, only square regions are intelligently handled by Spyral, it'd be nice to have Hex
* Widget disabling
* Finalize actors
* Creating and destroying widgets on the fly
* Clipboard functionality
* Caption and Icon API
